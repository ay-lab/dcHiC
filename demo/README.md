## Information

The .zip file has a demo directory to test dcHiC. As a
testing example, principal component (PC) values for
mouse ESC (4 replicates), NPC (3 replicates) and CN
(5 replicates) are provided in the **ESC_NPC_CN_100Kb** directory. 

We are also providing demo files to recreate the
results for pseudo-bulk single cell 3D genome. For testing,
we are providing the **mouse_cortex_single_cell3D** and
**mouse_hippocampus_single_cell3D** directories with the required
files and the expected results folder. The same directories
contain the `run_dchic.sh` script to recreate the results.

The scripts directory contains the basic but necessary
scripts to reproduce the results while packages directory
contains the accessory programs that needs to be installed
before the dcHiC run.
