# dcHiC HTML Demo Page

dcHiC contains a built-in utility to create beautiful, standalone HTML files to visualize compartments and other data. See examples from the paper below, or build your own with this [tutorial](https://github.com/ay-lab/dcHiC/wiki/Mice-Neural-Differentiation-Tutorial). Four examples are included here. 

## HOMER vs dcHiC

See [this page](https://ay-lab.github.io/dcHiC/html/dchic_homer.html) for a comparison of HOMER and dcHiC compartments. It contains the following tracks:  
```markdown

```

## Complete Mice Neural Differentiation (with dcHiC)

See [this page](https://ay-lab.github.io/dcHiC/html/multiWayMiceComplete.html) for complete mice neural differentiation overview. It contains the following tracks: 
```markdown
dcHiC Compartments
mESC/NPC LaminB1 Profile
RNA-Seq Data
ChIP Signals - H3K9me3, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac
```

Notable **mESC**-specific genes include: Dppa2/4, Zpf42   
Notable **NPC/CN**-specific genes include: Ptn, Ephb1, Dcx, Rmst   

## Hematopoiesis 

See [this page](https://ay-lab.github.io/dcHiC/html/hematopoiesis.html) for compartment dynamics during mice hematopoetic differentiation. 

Notable **granulocyte**-specific (activation/inactivation) genes: Sox6, Abca13

## Human Tissue 

See [this page](https://ay-lab.github.io/dcHiC/html/NormalCellLines.html) for compartments across 11 normal human cell lines/tissue Hi-C samples. 

Notable **immune** (Naive Germinal B / GM12878) specific gene: CD84 
Notable **hippocampus**-specific gene: KLK6
