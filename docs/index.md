# dcHiC HTML Demo Page

dcHiC contains a built-in utility to create beautiful, standalone HTML files to visualize compartments and other data. See examples from the paper below, or build your own with this [tutorial](https://github.com/ay-lab/dcHiC/wiki/Mice-Neural-Differentiation-Tutorial). Four examples are included here. 

## HOMER vs dcHiC
